# go-dsa

# Abstract
This is a library initially used as a way to study Data Structures and Algorithms. The final purpose may vary, but also with the idea in mind to provide a well designed and high performance basic data structures library for Golang.

# Data Structures:
- List
- Heap (priority queue)
- Trie (maybe both most common versions, basic and compressed)

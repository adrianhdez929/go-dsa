# Abstract
This is a library initially used as a way to study the topic of Data Structures and Algorithms. The final purpose may vary, but also with the idea in mind to provide a well designed and high performance basic data structures library for Golang.

# Data Structures:
- Iterable and Iterator interface for declarative sentences through data structures (map, filter, reduce, etc...)
- List
- Heap (priority queue) **(coming soon...)**
- Trie (maybe both most common versions, basic and compressed) **(coming soon...)**
